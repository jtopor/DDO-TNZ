# Complete Cases

On an initial read of the data we find the following:

- 53281 complete cases

- 6119 rows with NA's

- 10.3% of rows have NA's

However, many of the categorical variables are comprised of character strings that are simply blank. Such strings should logically be considered as missing (or "NA"). As such, after converting the blank strings to "NA" values we find the following:

- Only 27813 complete cases

- 31587 rows with NA's

- 53.17% of rows have NA's

### Administrative / Non-Predictive Variables

| Administrative Variables | Data Type |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| id                       | int       |
| date_recorded            | date      |
| recorded_by              | char str  |


The administrative variables shown above have no predictive value and will be ignored for purposes of model building. The __id__ variable serves as a unique identifier for each data record within the data set. The __date_recorded__ variable indicates the date on which the each record presented within the data was collected, while the __recorded_by__ variable contains the name of the survey firm that collected the data.
